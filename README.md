## Dotfiles

### What are dotfiles?

Dotfiles are configuration files on Unix-like systems that are used to customize the user environment. They are named with a leading dot, which is conventionally not shown in directory listings. Dotfiles are hidden by default on Unix-like systems, which is why they are often referred to as "hidden files."

### Installation

To install the dotfiles, choose the appropriate installation method for your operating system.
